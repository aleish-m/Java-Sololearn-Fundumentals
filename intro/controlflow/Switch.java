/*
  Code Challenge - Boxes
    You are making a robot that should categorize items by their color.
    Each color corresponds to a box with a specific number.
    For simplicity, our program will handle 3 colors:
      red goes to box #1
      green goes to box #2
      black goes to box #3
    Your program needs to take a color as input and output the corresponding box number.
  Sample Input
    green
  Sample Output
    2
