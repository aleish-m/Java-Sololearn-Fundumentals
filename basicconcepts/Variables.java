/* 
- int holds integers (whole numbers).
- double holds decimal numbers.
- float is similar to double, but has less precision and requires less memory.
- You need to use an f prefix after the value to make it a float (for example: 3.14f)
- char holds a single character.
- boolean can have one of the following values: true or false.
